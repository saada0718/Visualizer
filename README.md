# Visualizer

This program creates a visual representation of the different algorithms. The four algorithms that I have chosen
for this project are binary tree, bubble sort, linked list, and maze generator.

I have used code from different sources:
  - Button Class (The code is the pinned comment in the comments):

  - Maze generation algorithm:
